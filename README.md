UPDATE
========
The original author of the plugin has decided to pick up where he has left off. I will no longer be contributing to this repository. I recon you download the official plugin and its updates here: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/gringotts/

I originally decided to update the plugin because someone requested it, and only a few things had needed to be fixed.

Gringotts
---------
This plugin was intially updated as per someone wanting a working version to support 1.7.10+ minecraft servers. This includes such updates, and as well as several bug fixes. I take no authority to claim this plugin as one of my own.

This plugin is now maintained for my own benefit.
