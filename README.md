Gringotts
=========
Continued development of the Gringotts plugin as seen on BukkitDev, now supporting 1.7.10 clients. Most errors/crashes have been fixed, and I can guarantee the current build is now stable. I've tested this with Craftbukkit, and Spigot, and it seems to be running fine without any issues.

*This is not my plugin, I do not claim my self to own the code, other than my own code. All credit goes respectively to the original authors :).
